**Automaton** is a 1.21.1 Fabric mod with the sole purpose of making live recordings from spectator mode better. Made as an unofficial side project for Blanketcon 25, it contains a few quality of life features for the sake of recording.

## Entity Tracking
Press B to lock on to any entity.
NOTE: This feature has issues at lower and unstable framerates as of right now. If you are struggling with these, set FPS cap to 20 to sync with the tick-rate or just dont use it.

## Teleport Spots
You can set a teleport spot with I, and return to said spot with J.
This is done through a serverside tp command and can only be ran when in spectator.

## Spectator Invisibility
All spectators are fully invisible, to avoid having issues with spectators blocking the view.
